    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Bipolar disorder patients struggle often to manage their disorder and suffer from a variety of side effects from their medication. For those who seek professional medical help, or even in deciding what help to seek, some of them seek help from online communities such as Reddit. Medication is a big part of the online discourse, and to this end, a data science project was undertaken to explore posts from the r/bipolar subreddit mentioning 3 main mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder, namely lithium, lamotrigine (Lamictal) and quetiapine (Seroquel). The project focussed on the differences between the two main subtypes of bipolar disorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Natural Language Processing (NLP) component was involved. This part used exploratory data analysis (EDA) and NLP techniques such as word counts and VADER Sentiment Analysis to derive insights from the data. Negative VADER Sentiment Analysis compound scores indicate negative emotion, and the opposite indictates postive emotion. The exploration revealed that there were more posts with very negative VADER Sentiment compound scores from Bipolar 2 post authors as compared to Bipolar 1 post authors. Compound scores visualised by month showed that there were dips in compound scores for Bipolar 1 authors in April, September and October. There were dips in August and October for Bipolar 2 authors. These dips corresponded to suicidality trends mentioned in scientific literature. The score, when visualised by day of week, showed that Bipolar 2 authors experienced a dip on Tuesdays and Sundays. \n",
    "\n",
    "When posts mentioning serious topics were tracked by month, there was a dip in April for Bipolar 1 authors, meaning that even though they did not post on serious topics, their sentiment in posts they wrote was detected as more negative than what it usually would have been. Considering the previous findings, this could be taken as a cause for concern. This is because it might indicate that the authors did not think there was anything serious to discuss, but were undergoing mood instability in actual fact. When posts mentioning serious topics were tracked by day of week, there was a spike for Bipolar 2 authors on Sunday and Monday, but a dip on Sunday for Bipolar 1 authors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectorisation showed that both subtypes are predominantly concerned about side effects of their medication. Also, they seek advice on the subreddit about the first time they had an experience with the medications. Weight gain can also be observed as a side effect that users are highly concerned about. Reddit users tended to seek advice on either alternative mood stabilisers, or the multiple mood stabilisers they were taking. Also, words indicating specific side effects were seen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project also involved a classification component to detect the bipolar subtype of authors of posts within the given scope of the data. This was important as post authors have explictly declared their subtype for only a tenth of posts on the subreddit. If a classifier were to be built, this would increase the amount of labelled data available for research. The classifier would be primarily evaluated by its accuracy score, having an accuracy score of at least 0.7 to be considered as a candidate. The CatBoost Classifier on its default settings provided the best results, with a test accuracy score of 0.7. It had a (5-fold) cross-validated accuracy of 0.69 as well as a training accuracy of 0.89. In comparison, the baseline model, Random Forest, had a test accuracy of 0.65. It had a cross-validated accuracy of 0.65 and a training accuracy of 1 (severe overfitting). Other variations of models were tried, such as the CatBoost Classifier stacked with the XGBoost and LGBM Classifer models. The PyCaret library and several Scikit-learn models stacked together (LogisticRegression + KNeighborsClassifier + DecisionTreeClassifier + SVC + MultinomialNB) were also used. These did not perform better than the default CatBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have merely scraped the surface, and there is still much to be studied from the vast banks of user-generated text available on Reddit. In summary, this project has been a useful exercise to illustrate the potential of data science to reveal insights, as well as providing some practical action points for both clinicians and people with bipolar to better manange this serious condition. The project has revealed the concerns that Reddit users with bipolar post online, as well as laid the foundation for the classification of the 90% of posts on the subreddit which are currently unlabeled with their author's subtype. Future analyses could be done on a different scope, or current analyses could be used to develop material for psychoeducation to help treat bipolar (such as in the form of a Q&A verified by medical professionals).

    "Bipolar disorder is a serious mental disorder that affects 46 million of the world's population, or 0.3-1.2%. It has been observed that many bipolar individuals seek advice from online communitites such as Reddit about their disorder. Also, medication is a big part of the discourse. \n",

    "# Background and Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that affects 46 million of the world's population, or 0.3-1.2% ([*source*](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder)). As of 2017, 0.82% of the Singapore population suffers from the condition, and zooming in, 1.07% of the subpopulation of Singaporean 20-24 year olds ([*source*](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-bipolar-disorder-by-age?country=~SGP)). In the United States, the corresponding numbers are 0.68% and 0.96% ([*source*](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-bipolar-disorder-by-age?country=~USA)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suicide is the leading cause of premature death for bipolar sufferers ([*source*](https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/evidence-and-research/learn-more-about/463-bipolar-disorder-fact-sheet)). The suicide rate for bipolar patients is about 10–30 times higher than the corresponding rate in the general population ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723289/)). Also, up to 20% of bipolar patients (mostly untreated) end their life by suicide, and 20–60% make an attempt least once in their life ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723289/)). Bipolar patients also have an \"increased risk of death from all causes\" which is double than that expected in the general population ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4939858/)). People with bipolar died on average between 9 to 20 years younger than people in the general population, and for people with recurrent depression, they died around seven to 11 years younger ([*source*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20128)). In comparison, heavy smokers died eight to 10 years younger ([*source*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20128)). This means smoking 20 or more cigarettes a day ([*source*](https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/bipolar-disorder-advisor/when-bipolar-disorder-presents-consider-cardiovascular-comorbidities/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main subtypes of bipolar disorder. Bipolar I is characterised by both extreme highs and lows (mania and depression), while Bipolar II has predominantly depression episodes, but with less extreme highs (termed as hypomania) ([*source*](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder)). A survey of 11 countries indicated the lifetime prevalence of Type 1 to be at 0.6% and Type 2 to be at 0.4% ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3486639/)). Both manic and depressive symptoms can occur simultaneously in the form of a mixed episode, which carries a serious risk of suicide ([*source*](https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/mixed-bipolar-disorder)). It is important to diagnose the subtype correctly, as the treatment plan will be different depending on which of the symptoms are more dominant ([*source*](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bipolar-disorder/expert-answers/bipolar-treatment/faq-20058042)) ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5310104/)). Mood stabilisers are the mainstay of bipolar treatment, which aim to counter both the depression and the mania (albeit with several side effects) ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5310104/)) ([*source*](https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/treating-bipolar-medication)) ([*source*](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/mood-stabilisers)) as opposed to a unidirectional effect, such as from antidepressants. The common mood stabilisers are lithium, lamotrigine (brand name: Lamictal), quetiapine (brand name: Seroquel) and valproate ([*source*](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/top-mood-stabilizers-bipolar-disorder)) ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5310104/)). These drugs have been prescribed for decades ([*source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))) ([*source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamotrigine)) ([*source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine)) ([*source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproate)). Lithium is an antimanic drug, lamotrigine and valproate are anticonvulsants and quetiapine is an antispsychotic ([*source*](https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/treating-bipolar-medication)). These drugs are now being used as mood stabilisers ([*source*](https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/treating-bipolar-medication)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bipolar disorder is possibly left untreated in half of diagnosed individuals in any given year ([*source*](https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/evidence-and-research/learn-more-about/463-bipolar-disorder-fact-sheet)). However, the associated stigma and discrimination may prevent sufferers from seeking help ([*source*](https://www.who.int/mental_health/management/info_sheet.pdf)). The disorder is \"associated with significant impairment in work, family and social life, beyond the acute phases of the illness\" ([*source*](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/228249)). Bipolar disorder is frequently misdiagnosed as depressive disorder, which may result in an exacerbation of their condition due to the prescription of antidepressants ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945875/)). This is because patients tend to seek medical attention only when they are in the depressive phase of the illness ([*source*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945875/)). The aforementioned mood stabilisers are prescribed as a treatment for bipolar depression, with antidepressants only as a last resort ([*source*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bdi.12860)). Treatment satisfaction is important for one's perspective about being able to cope with bipolar disorder ([*source*](https://www.dbsalliance.org/education/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-statistics/)). People with bipolar can face up to ten years of struggling with the disorder before they can be diagnosed as having bipolar ([*source*](https://www.dbsalliance.org/education/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-statistics/)). Therefore, it is important to have conversations about bipolar medications, and about diagnosis of bipolar types as well.\n",

    "The data for this project will come from Reddit. About half of Reddit users come from the United States, and about two-thirds of them are male ([*source*](https://www.alphr.com/demographics-reddit/)).

       "63   Today, I met with my therapist, and I could tell that I was talking extremely fast. I am also anxious beyond belief and I can't shut off my brain. I took some Klonopin and it seemed to work somewhat, mainly to make the anxiety less acute. I called my doctor to set up and appointment, because I don't think the mood stabilizer I'm on (Rexulti + I take Lamictal) isn't working. I mean, Lamictal is, but Rexulti is clearly not under any circumstances. He recently put me on Seroquel, but I went off it when I went inpatient. I honest to god think inpatient did nothing for me, except I was put on Buspar and have less ideation and intrusive thoughts. This is just a long stream of consciousness, obviously. \\n\\nI've dealt with this for 15 years, and one would think that I have better coping skills with mania/hypomania come on and overtake my life, but currently, I think nothing is working.

       "106                             I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2 about a year ago, and I've been on the medication roller coaster ever since. I'm currently on Latuda, Lamictal, and Wellbutrin; I also take Benztropine for the side effects.\\n\\nSomething I've noticed (and my girlfriend has noticed) is that my sex drive is a shadow of what it used to be. I've gone from sex 3-4 days a week, to sex every few weeks. It's not that I don't want to, I just don't get aroused easily anymore! \\n\\nI was actually pretty hypersexual, and made very dangerous decisions back when I was single and unmedicated, and I don't want to go back to that. I'm lucky to have survived without catching something or getting murdered. But I would like to get back to the point where I'm interested in sex almost daily again.\\n\\nAlso, and this might be TMI, but &gt;!the strength of my orgasms and the volume of semen I produce has noticeably decreased).!&lt;\\n\\nHas anyone experienced anything similar?

       "135  Dr. Kay Jamison is a Professor of Psychiatry who specializes in mood disorders and she herself has Bipolar disorder. In her memoir An Unquiet Mind, she lists this advice for taking lithium:\\n\\n&gt; Always keep in perspective how much better you are. Everyone else certainly points it out often enough, and annoyingly enough, it's probably true.\\n\\nI started taking lithium this summer and this advice has rung completely true. I feel flatter than I'm used to, I still have lots of down days, and I swore it wasn't doing anything at all.\\n\\nLo and behold I have a chat with my mom and boyfriend this week and they both say how much better I've been doing!

       "154  So, today I wanted to write about more practical mechanics of losing weight on Seroquel. I did write about the psychology of it in my halfway post on my blog, but links might not be allowed, so ask me if you want it.\\n\\nThe reason I decided to put this article together, is I didn’t believe it’s possible to lose weight while taking Seroquel. This medication changes your metabolism and your feeling of hunger. So if you will just eat normally (whenever you are hungry) you will start gaining weight — in fact, obesity is one of the most common side-effects of this medication.\\n\\nAlso, there is something to say for food as a way to do mild mood regulation, there is even a term “comfort food” :)\\n\\n**Between starting Seroquel, dealing with being diagnosed and fired from my job because of it, and moving to America I gained 30 kilos (66 lbs).**\\n\\nIn the post above I already talked about why I wanted to lose and how I stayed motivated.

I was diagnosed in 2011 and have been on different psych meds since.. but sometimes going off at my own will right before having a huge downward spiral and inevitably ending up back in the doctors office with another prescription. My new psych (ins change) says I should be on an anti-depressant, mood stabilizer and an anti-psychotic. I know I’m not on the mild side of bipolar but that makes me feel nervous. She said that anger and rage isn’t often a side affect directly related to bipolar so I need to have an extra med to handle that. So the new med lineup is supposed to be Lamictal, Prozac, Abilify and Cymbalta… I think she plans to remove the Prozac soon but I don’t know what she said. Has anyone had this combo or anyone just have some general words of encouragement? Despite living with it for so long, I’m still afraid every day and of every change. Thank you friends ❤️</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello I am fairly new to medication and I'd like to continue treatment. I will be uninsured after this year and I am worried about my access to my medication. Meeting with my provider is too expensive without insurance. I'm wondering if anybody has any advice for medication management without insurance? I know there are some apps that apparently connect you with a provider for a subscription fee (such as Plushcare) but are they legitimate and affordable? Also, how often are you supposed to meet with your psychiatrist to continue to receive basically a lifelong prescription? Every 3 months or fewer? I'm in Atlanta and I'm taking Lamotrigine. Thank you so much for your help!</td>\n",

I am taking pregabalin for chronic neck pain...lamictal, quetiapine, and sertraline for bipolar. Can pregabalin induce mania?? I can't find any decent articles online, but seriously feel this stuff is wild. I'm getting wild. Its supposed to be good for bipolar. I wonder if it is inducing mania due to the condition, or if it is a side effect anyone without bipolar could also have? Has anyone else experienced this?   \n",

I’m not sure if it’s my meds or just me. I can’t remember if I used to be this way before meds. Also… definitely sure it’s not anxiety. Any exercises I do this happens. Even if its just a simple task at home. Ugh! Example… I am a Jiu Jitsu practitioner. I get super hot, red, and sweat like mad way before anyone else. It’s embarrassing as hell. But I still go anyway. I’m just looking to see if anyone else has this issue on meds as well. Anyone?   \n",

Horrible depression, racing thoughts, couldn’t stop cutting myself, had to get stitches, super impulsive, hearing voices telling me to kill myself, paranoid. Psychiatrist made me go to the hospital to get admitted. Another psych ward stay. Which brings my total to lucky number 13. I was taken off abilify and put on zyprexa. I was skeptical at first but omg I am starting to feel so much better. Yesterday and today especially I feel like myself again. Maybe this could be the magical combination everyone keeps talking about. I’m still hesitant but hopeful which is encouraging because I couldn’t tell you the last time I had any kind of hope. Lithium, depakote, zyprexa. I promise to keep taking you if you promise to keep working. 🤞🏻🤞🏻 I hope you all are doing ok too. What’s your magical combination?   \n",

So, my appointments - if he even gets to me, are short as fuck. But that's another story. There's always the Psych E.R.,   I'm getting to the point where I need to go there, because I've been on Seroquel since July 50mg at bedtime (Rx'ed by an E.R. Dr after having an extreme reaction to a birth control pill, tried 3x to slowly taper down (been an even bigger disaster each time),   seem to be withdrawing every afternoon. I'm just curious what others have experienced is all. :)   \n",
       "6   I (20m) know that when I’m manic I don’t sleep much. I know that when I’m depressed I sleep a lot. It’s almost like I’d rather be depressed at this point, because at least I can sleep. I self medicated with marijuana for years and after my ex of 2 1/2 years left me, the marijuana stopped helping and I noticed that not even that could get me to sleep anymore… it’s like the loss triggered my mania to become something unbearable… like an intense rollercoaster of anger, excitability, delusional thoughts, intense marijuana use and occasional alcohol abuse. I just got out of the hospital last Monday for a scary manic episode I had where I convinced myself I’d never sleep again. I’m on Seroquel daily and trazadone as needed now and it seems to be helping a bit but sobriety is so hard. :/ Up until today my symptoms have been manageable but I’m just so exhausted and irritated I just wanna smoke. I feel like my mania and depression cycles have been happening weekly lately. Anyways, thank you...   \n",

But I tried depakote, and it made me lose a ton of my hair, gain weight and didn’t prevent a pretty rough mixed episode. Then lithium put me in the ER last night. So I’m not saying I’m throwing in the towel to find the right medication, but has anyone found a lifestyle that helps them without medication? Or is it just part of the deal that meds are necessary?   \n",

I'm trying to figure out how to get back to a healthy weight, so I was wondering if I'd need to go off these meds in order to do that. I take 300mg of Quetiapine nightly, and I'm trying to get a new psychiatrist (old one moved away) but the earliest appointment for that is in March. I really need to make a change though, I'm really young and 350ish lbs and I really feel like I've just eaten my way out of a lot of things i could be doing in my early 20s. And the weight is starting to affect other health things like my sleeping. So, tl;dr, has anyone been able to lose weight while on Quetiapine/Seroquel, and how? (And note that i can't do any low-carb diets like Keto. I've tried before but I just crash)   \n",

       "11  I was out at dinner last night having an amazing time, but the conversation slowly turned into talking about two women who are bipolar (someone’s ex-wife and a coworker). Everyone was casually laughing about how bipolar they were, how they were unpredictable, irresponsible, horrible and unmedicated… and inside I was like, wow I am so sorry for these women not getting the help they need. Not having the right treatment. I was one of these women before 10 months of outpatient therapy and being sober and on the right balance of medications for years. I was silently listening to them tell the story while also reaching into my purse to take my Latuda and Seroquel (which I always take at night after dinner). Just interesting to hear people shit on people like me without even knowing it. I smiled and listened and thought, “if they only knew how much this hurts!” I also wanted to add that it was a dinner with people who I’m not very close with, so I didn’t feel it was appropriate to speak u...   \n",

Yesterday, I finally got my psychiatrist to get me away from Anti-psychotics. So now I’m taking 15mg of Remeron and holy shit, I actually feel alive for once and it feels way too good. No zombie effects, no morning grogginess that last for hours, no feeling like actually shit all day until I fall asleep to start the cycle over again. I was actually so scared to take Remeron due to how Seroquel made me feel but here I am. I have only taken a single dose so far but I just feel like I’m on Planet-9 and I’m so grateful.   \n",

It's like I'll have some stability and then it all goes to shit again. But this time I physically feel like shit too. I just need some encouragement that it gets better. Luckily I'm studying counseling and am so afraid of a failed suicide attempt (it would get me kicked out of my program) that I won't do anything. But life just doesn't feel worth this amount of pain. It's been over three years since I was diagnosed and I just can't take it anymore. Yesterday I was so nauseous and threw up and I think it's from the lithium. I have so much homework to do but I just don't want to do it and can't focus to do it and I'm broke and I just hate it here. I have like no friends.   \n",

Like I could actually sit with it and be okay. 2) I didn’t get as upset in traffic like usual but when I did, it didn’t stick with me for hours like it usually does. I was laughing it off in no time.

I’d been on imipramine for awhile as treatment for depression before my diagnosis with BP II. It was the only antidepressant that didn’t just make me feel numb but not better. When diagnosed, psych added lamotrigine and that did seem to work well. However, not being doing well at all recently (hypomanic) and ahead of seeing psych again I’ve been doing a lot of reading on different meds for BP. In all of that reading I’ve not found any mention of imipramine and I’m now starting to wonder if I should still be on it at all. Thanks.   \n",

My psych started me on lamictal and at first it seemed to calm my mind but im still titrating up and am having a rough time waiting out the process of getting to at least 100 mg. Ill go a week feeling very \"up\", overblown self confidence, overly happy and talkative when im normally very shy and quiet, and i can get easily irriated and angry really quickly. With others i usually just get quiet when i feel my anxious anger come on, but with my husband i have hardly any control. I don't get why and i hate it. I had a rough long 14 hour day, could feel an anger episode coming on, and when i got home, i made a comment about a chore not being done ( my husband is off work for now and is home all day) we started arguing and i was just seeing red, i was screaming at him, he was screaming at me. I tell him i need space when this happens but he always wants to talk it through right away, i tell him im not ready to talk but i feel like...   \n",

I was diagnosed in 2011 and have been on different psych meds since.. but sometimes going off at my own will right before having a huge downward spiral and inevitably ending up back in the doctors office with another prescription. My new psych (ins change) says I should be on an anti-depressant, mood stabilizer and an anti-psychotic. I know I’m not on the mild side of bipolar but that makes me feel nervous. She said that anger and rage isn’t often a side affect directly related to bipolar so I need to have an extra med to handle that. So the new med lineup is supposed to be Lamictal, Prozac, Abilify and Cymbalta… I think she plans to remove the Prozac soon but I don’t know what she said. Has anyone had this combo or anyone just have some general words of encouragement? Despite living with it for so long, I’m still afraid every day and of every change. Thank you friends ❤️   \n",
       "31  Was only recently diagnosed bipolar a few months ago. I’m on Lamictal 50mg so it doesn’t really do anything yet (working dose is 100mg) For the last month and a half I barely slept then started to crack towards the end. Anyways that ended about 2 weeks ago when I forced myself to smoke weed for a few days (I have no tolerance so it hit me hard) and took extra precaution to get my sleep in. I’ve definitley been “down”, but I also have an unhealthy home environment. So i wouldn’t necessarily say I’m depressed even though I’ve self harmed in the last week and am often feeling awful, almost sick. A lot of people would be unhappy in my situation. Anyways , I’m last few days I’ve started working out again, actually studying for school, feeling more in control of my life, sleeping 8+ hours a day, etc. I took my test today and haven’t felt like that in so long. I literally logged in a nearby cemetery yesterday. And stretched and did ab work. I definitley felt better when I wasn’t sleeping,...   \n",

It's been 4 days since my last dose and the last 2 I've been nauseous and unable to sleep. Looking for ways to ease symptoms I found that seroquel tapering should be done over a period of months not weeks (250, 200, 125, 62.5, 0). Am I going to be okay or should I expect withdrawal to get a lot worse? Anyone been in a similar spot able to share their experience? Also, if anyone knows ways to ease withdrawal symptoms, please let me know   \n",

Any recommendations for medication that might be more effective or that you have found it to be effective for yourself? Also always walking that fine line between lifting the depression and not shifting into a manic episode. Any thoughts are appreciated in advance!   \n",

       "38  I have BP1 and I've been severely depressed for 3 months now after a manic/psychotic episode that put me in hospital. Today my doctor gave me 4 choices of meds I could add on for depression (I'm already on meds to prevent mania). I'm wondering about people's experiences with these but first let me describe the depression and what I'm looking for. The depression is anhedonic. I'm sad, amotivated, I can't think about much of anything (very slow thoughts if any), and I can barely move. I sleep until the afternoon because I can't concentrate on any activities. I'm very cognitively impaired and find basic tasks difficult and confusing. I need something that will help me think more and be more motivated and active. Here are the choices:  lamotrigine (Lamictal)  bupropion (Wellbutrin)  pramipexole (Mirapex)  minocycline (an anti-inflammatory antibiotic) What have your experiences with these been, if any?

I have pretty severe agoraphobia and emetophobia and my psych wants me to be able to get out of the house. I’m posting here because I saw a couple other posts about Lamictal on this sub when I was searching around online I’m absolutely terrified that I’m going to get sick. They tried Abilify for me recently and I ended up fainting and throwing up after just one dose. We stopped it right after, but since I have such an intense and severe phobia of vomiting, it was absolutely petrifying. I didn’t eat or leave the bathroom for days. I’m terrified of this happening again. I’d love to hear any and all experiences you guys have had with Lamictal. Thanks in advance!   \n",
       "43  Hi all, long time creeper but new poster. I was diagnosed with Bipolar I when I was 18 but had signs before that. I have had a really solid last 11+ years without any major issues than the occasional long term depression or manic kick but nothing when like when I was younger and would go into psychosis. I started medication, Latuda, for the first time ever back in June. I had some weird side effects so in September my doctor switched me to Abilify but I had similar issues. During September I started feelings really depressed but also had a lot of other mixed emotions. I didn’t think much of it. Early October though I stopped taking my Abilify and due to some miscommunications with my doctor I didn’t get started on Lithium like she wanted. Well my shit fell apart mid October and I have been in the worst shape of my life since. My mind is everywhere, my moods are insane as are my feelings. My wife is scared and nervous and I feel like I am ruining everything. Luckily the job is good ...   \n",

My wife has come to terms that she may be bipolar, and while waiting for a specialist to see her for a formal diagnosis, her psychiatrist has perscribed abilify to deal with the low energy. Any warnings we should know about? My wife is an RN who I will be sharing this with, so anyone with technical knowledge is a plus :)   \n",

I've never been on latuda before, but she said it's supposed to boost my mood and generally keep me feeling better. Is anyone else taking this cocktail or meds and if so, what's your experience?   \n",
       "46  I've been doing fine for weeks, but today I feel like I've been hit by a bus. I had a dream last night that triggered some sad memories about times I've been wronged and manipulated. I woke up feeling miserable, paranoid, but more than anything just depressed. It only escalated throughout the day; I ended up leaving work early. I've been experiencing terrible rage and loathing. I feel like I have unfinished business with a bunch of people who are no longer in my life. I have a tendency to cut people off so fast that no fight ever goes down. It's because I'm terrified of conflict, it always makes me cry, but it has led to me carrying a lot of baggage. The worst part is that I put this on myself, but here I am resenting the people around me for being happy and normal. The way I feel is so complicated that I haven't even finished figuring out what's even going on. I guess I'm just hoping someone else understands this type of gutting sensory overload, or knows like, what the deal with ...   \n",

I will be uninsured after this year and I am worried about my access to my medication. Meeting with my provider is too expensive without insurance. I'm wondering if anybody has any advice for medication management without insurance? I know there are some apps that apparently connect you with a provider for a subscription fee (such as Plushcare) but are they legitimate and affordable? Also, how often are you supposed to meet with your psychiatrist to continue to receive basically a lifelong prescription? Every 3 months or fewer? I'm in Atlanta and I'm taking Lamotrigine. Thank you so much for your help!   \n",
